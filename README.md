# Simplified-Blackjack-Game

## About the game

The rules are simple, the player places a bet and then receives a set of cards from the dealer (from a 28 card “half”* deck containing
the cards 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A) until they bust by exceeding the limit of 42 (or reach 42 exactly). The final score is the sum of the cards
before the final card that caused the bust. The house then deals on their own behalf against the players .. Highest score wins! A draw is a no-contest and the bet is returned to the player.
